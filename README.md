# Butkii's Portfolio 👔

## Welcome! 👋
Hello! I'm Butkii (call-sign), and this is my first personal(non tech) portfolio website. I created this project to showcase my skills and display some of my work. I hope you enjoy it!

## About This Project
This portfolio is a simple, responsive website that serves as my digital resume. It was built to demonstrate my **core skills** [e.g.,drawing,  painting,  sketching,  logo design, Banner/Poster design,  YT- Thumbnail design].

means--
1. I'm a full time artists✏️, part-time monitor+keyboard player⌨️ .
2. I mostly like ENTER-KEY ⌨️, just after every **;** 👀, one day i'll break it into pieces👍.
